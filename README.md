# Spinnrd
Spinnrd is a daemon that translates accelerometer data into xrandr 
orientations. It can be used to autorotate a tablet or phone's display to 
match the orientation.

## Requirements
### Building
- [Rust](rust); more specifically, [Cargo](cargo) *(Cargo technically isn't 
  necessary as long as you have the Rust compiler, but it'll save you tons 
  of work)*
### Running
- iio-sensor-proxy *(For the FSAccel backend, which is the only one 
  currently implemented)*

## Basic autorotation
Start a spinnrd process as a service (you'll probably want to use 
--daemonize). Then, have your display manager run spinnr.sh (backgrounded) 
as part of its startup script. Your display should now change to match your 
device's orientation! If you want to tweak the sensitivity, spinnrd has 
a variety of command-line options for doing this.
